# TODO
- Search functionality
- View local cache maybe?
- Correct implementation of "delete messages" setting
- History handler, so we know what's been played
- Automatically display queue with UIHandler if env setting
- Handle if metadata has been downloaded, but somehow the file does not exist (or the Song's Filename parameter is null)
- Actual env example
- Fix documentation
- Provide installation instructions (and figure out how to put this into prod lol)
- Downloaded song library management, like size, number of songs etc
- Consistency in saying song names in response messages
