# TODO
- do not leave channel when playback ended, maybe configurable timeout after it has been left alone
- Needs checks for all playback commands to force users to be in a voice channel
- Automatically display queue with UIHandler if env setting (should probably be in sync with next todo item)
- Consistent ephemeral messages (maybe config option?)
- Make search respond instantly so the user knows what's happening
- View local cache maybe?
- Correct implementation of "delete messages" setting
- History handler, so we know what's been played
- Handle if metadata has been downloaded, but somehow the file does not exist (or the Song's Filename parameter is null)
- Actual env example
- Fix documentation
- Provide installation instructions (and figure out how to put this into prod lol)
- Downloaded song library management, like size, number of songs etc
