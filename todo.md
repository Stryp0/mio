# TODO
- Per-server onboarding and configuration options
- Migrate song database to sqlite as well
- Needs checks for all (playback only?) commands to force users to be in a voice channel
- Automatically display queue with UIHandler if env setting (should probably be in sync with next todo item)
- History handler, so we know what's been played
- Handle if metadata has been downloaded, but somehow the file does not exist (or the Song's Filename parameter is null)
- Downloaded song library management, like size, number of songs etc
- Actual env example
- Fix documentation
- Provide installation instructions (and figure out how to put this into prod lol)
